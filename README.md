# AdventOfCode

This project was built using Angular CLI. THe only reason for using angular is that I am used to it and scaffolding makes it very easy to add new stuff. Besides angulars components (created by ng g c), i'm trying to use ts only for typing. That means that each component has functions rather than class properties.

There is a small menu to choose from to select different days.
